The plugin provides functions to manage and display testimonials using a custom post type and a specific widget

== Description ==

This plugin is created using [WordPress Plugin Boilerplate](https://github.com/DevinVinson/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate)

The plugin adds a custom post type - Testimonial, which is accessible through the admin panel. The post type supports
post thumbnails. It's recommended to use the thumbnails to show a picture of the author.  The title of the post represents the
author's name. The posts text is a text of the testimonial.

The widget was added into plugin to allow displaying of the testimonials in widget areas of the site.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload `an-testimonialss` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
